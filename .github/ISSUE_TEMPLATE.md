## What to expect when you file an issue here

This is the repo for an in-progress rework of The Rust Programming Language book
available at http://rust-lang.github.io/book/.

If you are filing an issue about the existing book available at
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/, please note that we are now concentrating on
the new version of the book.

We would still love feedback on the existing book as well as the new book, just
know that one of a few things may happen with your issue:

- If we have not gotten to that topic in the new book, we may leave a note for
  ourselves about this issue to address when we get there.
- We may have already addressed this issue in a rewritten version of the topic
  relating to this issue, so we might close it.
- If this issue still applies to the new book, we will fix it.

If you have time before filing this issue, please take a look at the new book
to see if this issue has been addressed and include that information in the
issue.

Thank you for reading, you may now delete this text!
