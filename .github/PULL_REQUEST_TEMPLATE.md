## What to expect when you open a PR here

We are currently working with No Starch Press to bring this book to print.
Chapters go through a number of stages in the editing process, and once they've
gotten to the layout stage, they're effectively frozen.

For chapters that have gotten to the layout stage, we will likely only be
accepting changes that correct factual errors or major problems and not, for
example, minor wording changes.

Scroll all the way to the right on https://github.com/rust-lang/book/projects/1
to see which chapters have been frozen.

Thank you for reading, you may now delete this text!
